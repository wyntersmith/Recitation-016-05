# Meeting 1
- Discussed project plans and decided upon the features each team member would be implementing (currently including design plans and frontend pages)
- Discovered a bug in the nav-bar in which when leaving the Party Page via a nav-link, the user is automatically signed out (only occurs witht the party page)
- Should potentially update the register page to intake more user information
